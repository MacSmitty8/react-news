# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Details
This is a React App that utilizes the News API to display top headlines from many different news outlets and organizations(CNN, Fox News, CBS, etc). It also displays the articles authors, source, and image(s) used with the article. 

# Design
The website design was used by mixing CNN's Navbar, and a newspaper-like body with a 'new browser tab' look for the boxes of the news articles.

# Problems
Once again, the main problem was trying to get everything to show the stuff on the webpage. For some reason, it didn't work, so I had to redo the project since I couldn't pinpoint what the issue was. After I managed to get things to display, everything else was relatively easy.
